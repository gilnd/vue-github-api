Hello! :) 


This project is a simple showcase test of vuejs + tailwind + github API.
The main goal is to search github users with github api and show theme on a list, you can then click on the usernames to open their profile page on github.

### Pages
There are **2** pages in this project.

* **Home >** Is the homepage, it has a inputbox where you can type usernames and search them through github api. It will then display a list of users. If you click on the prompted cards it will open a new tab with their profile. 
* **History >** Is a page where you can find your history of searched keywords and the last results of your search. You can also clear keywords history or user results.

This is what the file tree looks like:

```

* **NavBar** > Navigation component wich changes rooter view.
* **Footer** > A minimalistic footer.
* **SearchUser** > A component where there is one inputbox where you can type usernames, if you press enter or click the search button it will emit one event to the *parent-component* which will then trigger the api call with the typed username.
* **UserCard** > A minimalistic card which prints the data returned from the github API. It only prints the username and the profile image.
